# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# There needs to be a space after the - and before the prefix. Don't use tabs anywhere in this file.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# If you're using characters such as # ' : - or the like in your changelog, surround the entire change with quotes as shown in the second example. These quotes don't show up on the changelog once it's merged and prevent errors.
# SCREW ANY OF THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
changes: 
- rscadd: Added a space market that spawns somewhere in space. It's guaranteed to spawn every round, but its location will be random each time. The space market allows you to exchange space credits for goods.
- rscadd: 
- rscadd: Vox traders spawn with coordinates of the space market in their backpack. If no vox traders spawn, the coordinates will be found somewhere on the vox outpost.
- rscadd: The space market has multiple docking ports and shuttle coordinate disks that can be inserted into the research, mining, trader and salvage shuttles to allow them to visit the space market.
