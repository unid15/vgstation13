# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# There needs to be a space after the - and before the prefix. Don't use tabs anywhere in this file.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# If you're using characters such as # ' : - or the like in your changelog, surround the entire change with quotes as shown in the second example. These quotes don't show up on the changelog once it's merged and prevent errors.
# SCREW ANY OF THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
changes: 
- tweak: "Changed the vault placement algorithm. Now 5-15 vaults will spawn on the beginning of the game, instead of 1-10. In addition, vaults can spawn close to each other now, and there is no longer a limit on the amount of vaults on one z-level."
- rscadd: "Added a /datum/map_element/customizable/vault_generator object that fills a selected rectangle with vaults."
